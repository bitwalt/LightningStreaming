Idea: Start new users with demo data and little popups. When they enter their first entry, popup about deleting their demo data. And have message "When you're ready to start tracking your own data, CLICK HERE to delete data"


Users should be able to edit their (add / delete) categories at their whim. More complicated with entries in a category though.
