# Open Source implementation of PPSPP protocol [RFC7574]

This implementation was tested in Linux and in MS Windows.

PPSPP with TCP is not defined in the RFC, so it is subject to change at any moment. This implementation of PPSPP interworks with the reference C++ implementation available at https://github.com/libswift/libswift
